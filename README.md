# 7-Segment Display Clicker

This Python project lets you interact with a 7-segment number display by clicking on different parts of the display to record values.  

I made it mainly to transcribe ciphers that use this as a character set. https://www.dcode.fr/7-segment-display is a great resource, but it took me too long to search for each character.
